This is regression testing for nix.
Each directory named with a number  represents a single test.
(e.g., 1/ 2/ ...)
A test directory may be also named k1, k2, k....
All k tests run affter all std. tests. They are meant to install ad-hoc
kernels for testing.

The script actually running the tests is runtests, which should be run from
cpustart during the machine boot process.
That is, include
	test -x /cfg/$sysname/runtests && /cfg/$sysname/runtests
in your  cpustart file.
It is not meant to start the testing sequence by hand.
To (re)run all the tests, you should run ./Tests instead.

See 1/ for a template. Copy it to your own and tweak it at will.

To start testing, run the script ./Tests in clu, which would
change the boot sequence such that the machine starts to run tests
(perhaps installing different kernels and rebooting) until all
tests have been run or one has failed.

Each directory must contain:

- kern:	a script used to compile and install a kernel used for testing
 if no such file is found, no new kernel is installed. the current one
 is used. Otherwise, the indicated kernel is installed and the machine
 reboots using this kernel.

- runtest: a script used to run a test. This is mandatory.

- whichever other files must be available for the tests to run.

Tests generate within each test directory:

- koutput:	a file keeping the output for a kern that did run
- output:	a file keeping the output for a test that did run
- FAIL:		an empty file, reporting that a test did fail.


BEWARE that if you install a kernel for a test then that kernel is used
for all following tests.
As a convention, tests installing a kernel should be named k0, k1, ...
test 1 installs the std kernel, so that all tests use the regular kernel.
